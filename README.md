# W2 Project - Data cleaning and wrangling
​
## Premise
​
In this project I assume that a large company is in the early stages of a new project. They want to hire me as a data analyst to collect information on whether a leg protection device would be appealing to surfers in places with a large number of shark attacks.
​
## Hypothesis
​
This project will attempt to prove whether a leg protection device is necessary for surfers, by checking the frequecy of surfing-related leg injuries versus other shark attacks. The data provided includes over 6,300 unique shark attacks ranging from fishing to standing in the water.  
​
## Project files
​
The main directory has 3 subdirectories:
* Input: Hidden in GitHub, the input folder holds the data used to analyze the hypothesis. It is a file containing most recorded shark attacks (anywhere in the world and as far back in time as Ancient Greece). The file can be downloaded and seen at https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks
* Output: Contains files created from the original data (new datasets, plots, etc.) that are used multiple times through the project.
* src: Contains python files with all functions created specifically for this analysis.

​
In the root directory there are 4 Jupyter Notebook files that include all the code used in the project:
* "Exploratory data analysis" (EDA): This file explores the data (how much data there is, how is it organized and the quality of it).
* Cleaning: This file gets rid of some of the data that will not be used and standarize the way that the data is written so it is easier to work with later. The data is also categorized more efficiently.
* Analysis: It checks whether the hypothesis is true or not.
* Visualization: The last file is used to create plots that help visualize the data in order to check the hypothesis and a small market analysis in case the company decides to move forward with its project.
​
## Conclusion
​
The data concludes that a leg protection device would protect surfers more than anyone else in the water. This same data could be used to persuade those surfers into buying the company's product. The data also concludes that the target market for these devices should be young men (teens to mid-thirties). There is no conclusion on whether this project would be economically viable, that should be explored as another hypothesis with an economic related set of data in a later stage of the company's project.
